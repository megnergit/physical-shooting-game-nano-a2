## Motivation

One day I saw this [web page](https://www.gizmodo.jp/2024/10/machi-ya-varishot-review_repost-796522.html) on GIZMODO, reporting a physical shooting game with physical target and toy pistols with a laser pointer installed inside. It reminds me of my enthusiasm on chopsticks guns [(somethign like this)](https://blog.cfms.jp/?p=10323) with rubber bands. I was not interested in shooting 'enemy' 
or anything that moves. I was not interested in any battles either (affirmatively hate them), but was purely interested in shooting a target. I was and still am fascinated in the precision of a mechanism. 

This 'VariShot' is quite expensive. In Europa it costs over 600 Euros. I can imagine, importing such toys will require a tons of explanations at a Zollamt. 

Okay, let us create one.

For a target,

- LED
- active speaker
- wires and pins
- Aluminum tape (to make a physical target)

For a pistol
- red laser
- Li-ion battery 18650
